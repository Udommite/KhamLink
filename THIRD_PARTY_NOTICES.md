# Third-party notices

## Selected corpus: thai_dict 1.0

Thai Wiktionary contributors; compiled by Wannaphong Phatthiyaphaibun / PyThaiNLP. The [artifact release](https://github.com/PyThaiNLP/pythainlp-corpus/releases/tag/thai_dict-v1.0) identifies Thai Wiktionary as its origin and **Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International** as its license. This is an artifact-specific determination, not an inference from the corpus repository's general license. [License and legal-code link](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).

The selected artifact, source URLs, registry commit, size, SHA-256, date, author attribution and limitations are recorded in [`sources/thai_dict-1.0.json`](sources/thai_dict-1.0.json). No upstream checksum was supplied; KhamLink pins the measured SHA-256 and verifies subsequent downloads. No large corpus file is included in this source tree's deliverable.

KhamLink's data transformations parse CSV meaning dictionaries, split/number senses, add IDs/source links, omit unmapped optional POS with quality flags, and create a separate derived retrieval index. Original Thai display strings and definitions are preserved. The normalized/adapted corpus data is made available under CC BY-SA 4.0 with attribution and modification notices retained. Source content and source excerpts shown in explanations retain the underlying data license. Do not apply additional restrictions to this licensed material. This notice does not purport to relicense unrelated application code.

Live per-word Thai Wiktionary article/history links identify contributing pages, but the release has no per-entry revision IDs. Frozen wording is bound to the downloaded artifact checksum, not represented as the current page's exact contents. This corpus is **not an official Office of the Royal Society dictionary**, and neither Wikimedia nor PyThaiNLP endorses KhamLink.

## HippoRAG

Method/reference: [OSU-NLP-Group/HippoRAG](https://github.com/OSU-NLP-Group/HippoRAG/tree/1438aba3fc44ff10573e5a5e1e7cc3c7f9794aff), commit `1438aba3fc44ff10573e5a5e1e7cc3c7f9794aff`, package metadata `2.0.0a5`. [HippoRAG 2 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14802). The official package is not installed; the local compatible-method adapter and its deviations are described in [architecture](docs/architecture.md). The upstream MIT attribution is retained below, from its [license file](https://github.com/OSU-NLP-Group/HippoRAG/blob/1438aba3fc44ff10573e5a5e1e7cc3c7f9794aff/LICENSE).

## Embeddings and generation

Default `thai-char-lsa-v1-d128` uses scikit-learn TF-IDF/SVD trained locally on the selected corpus. No third-party neural model weights are shipped. `dictionary-openie-extractive-v1`, `recognition-local-v1`, and `local-extractive-summary-v1` are local deterministic adapters. Derived corpus/index artifacts remain separated from source and retain corpus attribution. Optional neural/remote models require their own pinned revision, license/terms and processing approval before use; naming a configurable model does not approve its weights or license.

## Software dependencies and release packaging

Python versions are locked in `requirements.lock`; npm dependency versions and integrity hashes in `frontend/package-lock.json`. Preserve the licenses supplied with installed distributions, including transitive dependencies and bundled native runtimes. React/ReactDOM and the Vite build tool supply MIT notices; Python numerical wheels may contain additional BLAS/runtime notices beyond their top-level licenses. Playwright's browser distribution has its own bundled notices and is test-only, not an application runtime asset.

Every frontend build emits `assets/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt` from the actual installed React, ReactDOM, scheduler and Vite license files, including their copyright notices. The build fails if a required notice is missing. This file travels with the standalone frontend/Docker build and is available at `/assets/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt`; no attribution depends on retaining development `node_modules` in the deployed frontend.

Before distributing an image or binary, run `python scripts/license_inventory.py` in its environment. It writes a machine-readable inventory and copies actual installed license/NOTICE texts to ignored `artifacts/licenses/`. Bundle those generated notices with that distribution; do not rely on a top-level license label to replace bundled native-component notices. This inventory is release evidence, not legal approval of Q-003/Q-005.
